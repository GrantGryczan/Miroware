				It is obvious. W3Schools is simply the superior documentation site when it comes to web development. Don't you dare tell me about that "Mozilla" "deevloper " "Network" thing going on that seems to be increasing in popuparlity. It's hot garbage! Seriousl. Every single thing on the actual w3Schools WEBSITE is a bsolute perfection. ( I have proof!) And heres' why. It'ds because ,for every  thing on there, the reference accuracy, organization, and functionality is all purely genius in its practicality and conventionality. I love it so much, it has neen so helpful. Really, sjust really wow it's just great. Really!
